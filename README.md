# CPP 00

## Project Overview

**CPP 00** introduces core principles of C++ through two foundational exercises focused on command-line interaction and object-oriented programming.

This project focused on:

- Class design and encapsulation  
- Standard I/O streams  
- Static arrays and no dynamic memory  
- CLI interaction and formatted output  
- File structure with `.cpp` and `.hpp` files

## Exercise 00 – Megaphone

### Description
 
This simple command-line program takes a series of strings and **shouts them in all uppercase**, mimicking a megaphone.

### Concepts Practiced

- String manipulation with `std::toupper`
- Basic `std::cout` usage

## Exercise 01 – My Awesome PhoneBook

### Description

This exercise simulates a **terminal-based phonebook application**.
I built and manage a fixed-size (8 contacts) database with commands like `ADD`, `SEARCH`, and `EXIT`.

All contacts are stored using **custom** `Contact` **and** `PhoneBook` **classes**.

### Concepts Practiced

- Class design (private vs. public members)
- Input validation
- Static arrays and circular storage (FIFO overwrite)
- CLI formatting and column truncation
